# Q1.  Explain with an example each when to use a for loop and a while loop.
#
# Ans: For loops are used when you have a known number of iterations
# or when you want to iterate through a sequence (list, tuple, string, etc.)
# to perform an action for each item in the sequence.
#
# example for while loop

num = 0
while num<10:
    print(num)
    num = num+1

# example for  (for loop)

for i in range(10):
    print(i)
    
    
    
    
    
    

# Q2.  Write a python program to print the sum and product of the first 10 natural numbers using for  and while loop.
#
# ans:   example for (for loop):

sum = 0
product =1
for i in range(1,11):
    sum +=i
    product *=i
print("sum of the first 10 natural num: ",sum)
print("prodect of the first 10 natural num: ",product)

# ans:   example for while loop:

sum =0
product =1
i =1

while i <= 10:
    sum += i
    product *= i
    i += 1
print("sum of the first 10 natural num: ",sum)
print("prodect of the first 10 natural num: ",product)








# Q3. Create a python program to compute the electricity bill for a household.
# The per-unit charges in rupees are as follows: For the first 100 units,
# the user will be charged Rs. 4.5 per unit, for the next 100 units,
# the user will be charged Rs. 6 per unit, and for the next 100 units,
# the user will be charged Rs. 10 per unit, After 300 units and above
# the user will be charged Rs. 20 per unit. You are required to take
# the units of electricity consumed in a month from the user as input.
# Your program must pass this test case: when the unit of electricity consumed by the user in a month is 310,
# the total electricity bill should be 2250.
#
# ans:

units = int(input("Enter the units of consumed electricity: "))
if units <= 100:
    bill = units * 4.5
elif units <= 200:
    bill = 100 *4.5 + (units - 100 )*6
elif units <= 300:
    bill = 100 *4.5 + 100 * 6 +(units - 200) *10
else:
    bill = 100 * 4.5 +100 * 6 + 100 *1. +(units -300)* 20
print("Total bill: ",bill)








# Q4. Create a list of numbers from 1 to 100. Use for loop and while loop to calculate the cube of each number and if the cube of that number is divisible by 4 or 5 then append that number in a list and print that list.
# ans:

cube_devesible=[]

for i in range(1,101):
    cube = i ** 3
    if cube % 4 ==0 or cube % 5 == 0:
        cube_devesible.append(cube)
print(cube_devesible)

# ans:

cube_develible=[]
i = 0
while i <= 100:
    cube = i**3
    if cube % 4 ==0 or cube % 5 == 0:
        cube_develible.append(cube)
    i +=1
print(cube_develible)








# Q5.  Write a program to filter count vowels in the below-given string.
#
# ans:

string = "I want to become a data scientist"
vowels ="aeiouAEIOU"
count =0
for i in string:
    if i in vowels:
        count +=1
print(count)
