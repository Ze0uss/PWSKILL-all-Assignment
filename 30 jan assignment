#question 5:
​
If we know a specific number, such as 32, we can say 5 times, but for a given symbolic variable
"NUMBER" which represents any number in the world, how many times is not known a priori (before hand).
In this case, we could use a while loop to determine that answer:




#question 6:
​
n =int(input("Enter your num: "))
for i in range(n):
    print("*" *(n-i))
    
    
    
    
#question 7:
​
i = 10
while i > 0:
    print(i)
    i = i - 1
    
    
    

#question 8:
​
i = 10
while i > 0:
    print(i)
    i = i - 1
